3047. Largest Area of Square Inside Two Rectangles
🔹 Core Idea

A square can fit inside the intersection of two rectangles.

So for every pair of rectangles:

Find their overlapping region

From that region, the largest possible square side is:

side = min(overlap_width, overlap_height)


We need the maximum side² over all pairs.

🔹 Rectangle Intersection

For rectangles i and j:

left   = max(x1_i, x1_j)
right  = min(x2_i, x2_j)
bottom = max(y1_i, y1_j)
top    = min(y2_i, y2_j)

width  = right - left
height = top - bottom


If width <= 0 or height <= 0 → no intersection.

🔹 Square Inside Intersection

A square must fit completely inside the overlap:

max_square_side = min(width, height)
area = side * side

🔹 Algorithm
maxSide = 0
for i = 0..n-1:
  for j = i+1..n-1:
      compute overlap width & height
      side = min(width, height)
      maxSide = max(maxSide, side)

return maxSide * maxSide

🔹 Time & Space
Metric	Value
Time	O(n²)
Space	O(1)

n ≤ 1000, so n² = 10⁶ → totally fine.

🔹 Key Observations (Interview Points)

We don’t need all rectangles, only pairs

Bigger intersection ⇒ potentially bigger square

Square is limited by shorter side of the overlap

Intersection logic = max of starts, min of ends

🔹 Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting negative width/height
❌ Taking max(width, height) instead of min
❌ Not using long long for area
❌ Off-by-one in intersection boundaries

🔹 Mental Formula

Two rectangles → find overlap → smallest side → square → maximize
