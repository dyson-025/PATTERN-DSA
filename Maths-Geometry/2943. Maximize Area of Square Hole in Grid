🧠 Problem Core Idea

You have a grid formed by:

n + 2 horizontal bars

m + 2 vertical bars

Between bars are 1×1 cells.

Some bars are removable:

Horizontal: hBars

Vertical: vBars

If you remove consecutive bars, the cells between them merge, creating a bigger hole.

Goal 👉 Find the largest possible square area you can form.

🔑 Key Observation

To make a large square:

You need consecutive removable bars in both directions.

If you remove k consecutive bars → hole length becomes:

side
=
𝑘
+
1
side=k+1

So:

Find longest consecutive sequence in hBars

Find longest consecutive sequence in vBars

Square side = min(horizontal_side, vertical_side)

Area = side × side

🧩 Why +1 ?

Example:
Bars at positions: 2,3,4 (3 consecutive removals)

Cells merged = 4 units
So side = 3 + 1 = 4

🛠 Algorithm
Step 1 – Process one direction
Sort bars
Scan and count longest consecutive sequence
Answer = maxConsecutive + 1

Step 2 – Combine both directions
side = min(hSide, vSide)
area = side * side

⏱ Complexity

Sorting ≤ 100 elements

Time: O(k log k), k ≤ 100

Space: O(1) extra

n and m are large but irrelevant after input.

📝 Code Logic (Explained)
int findmaxl(vector<int>& Bars){
    sort(Bars.begin(), Bars.end());
    int consecutive = 1, maxl = 1;

    for(int i = 1; i < Bars.size(); i++){
        if(Bars[i] == Bars[i-1] + 1)
            consecutive++;
        else
            consecutive = 1;

        maxl = max(maxl, consecutive);
    }
    return maxl + 1;   // +1 gives actual hole size
}

int maximizeSquareHoleArea(int n, int m,
                           vector<int>& hBars,
                           vector<int>& vBars) {
    int side1 = findmaxl(hBars);
    int side2 = findmaxl(vBars);

    int side = min(side1, side2);
    return side * side;
}

🚨 Edge Cases

No consecutive bars → max sequence = 1 → side = 2

Single bar → still side = 2

One direction large, other small → limited by smaller one.

🧠 One-Line Insight

Largest square = (longest consecutive horizontal removals + 1)², bounded by vertical.
